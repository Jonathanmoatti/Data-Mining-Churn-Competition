# Data Mining Churn Competition
The task in this competition was to predict as accuratly as possible wether a telecommunication client would churn - or not.
 This project is an in-class competition amongst 52 students of the Masters in Business Intelligence at HEC Montreal.
The metric used to determine the performance of the model is accuracy.
The model i submitted for my XGBoost ranked first amongst all the models submitted by the 52 students in the class.

Also included in this work are the tools and functions that were built and used to clean the data. I inspired the bulk of the cleaning functions from the Fastai course on Machine Learning, as it allows for customizing functions that can be moduled and re-used for future works.

Bayesian Optimization was used to fine tune the hyper-parameter of my model (using the Scikit-Optimize library).

Note : Data Visualisation was not expected from this work. The core of the work that had to be done was on cleaning the data and process it appropriatly before creating the best performing model.
